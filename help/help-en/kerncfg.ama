                 %h*** Kernel configuration (CONFIG.SYS) ***


The SvarDOS (EDR) kernel is configured through the CONFIG.SYS file using
specialized keywords.

Conventions:
Keywords may include [HIGH] or [HI] (write them without brackets!), which both
indicate they will prioritize allocating High Memory (HMA) as storage, which
saves valuable Conventional memory whenever possible. Example: FILES, HIFILES,
and FILESHIGH. Of these three, the first one is the only one that exclusively
uses precious Conventional memory.

A LABEL, is a location in the CONFIG.SYS which is marked by the user, with a
two dots character followed by a unique string, like for example, ":ENDING"
(without double quotes). It is a reference used for GOTO, GOSUB and SWITCH
jumps when executing keywords.

The use of "n", "nn" and "nnn" (without double quotes) indicates a numeric
value the user must define.

Here is a list of possible settings:

[COMMON]                This keyword does not perform any action. It was 
                        designed for compatibility with MS-DOS 6.x.
                        This is the only keyword that should be written with 
                        brackets.

COUNTRY=[country number],[code page],[country.sys file location]
                        Country specific conventions to display times, dates,
                        currency, character sort order, forbidden characters,
                        mathematical separators, etc..
                        Consult the COUNTRY Addendum for further details
                        and country codes.

SHELL[HIGH]=\COMMAND.COM /E:512 /P
            Points to the location of the SHELL (command interpreter) to be
            used. An increased environment (/E value) prevents aborted
            programs, but consumes more memory. The /P switch makes the shell
            permanent, so that you cannot EXIT it. More SHELL switches may be
            available and can be queried at the command-line by entering
            COMMAND /?

[HI]LASTDRIVE or LASTDRIVE[HIGH]=X:
            Sets the last logical drive-letter to letter x. This is done to
            reserve at least two drive letters (Y: and Z:) for some vintage
            external drives which specifically fail if there are none
            available.

BREAK=ON/OFF            Enables stopping execution by pressing <Ctrl> + <C> on
                        your keyboard.

BUFFERS[HIGH]=nn        Built-in system-wide cache. For all types of drives.
                        It also sets the secondary read-ahead cache size.

[HI]FCBS=nn             If a program tries to open more than certain amount of
                        files by using file control blocks (FCB), EDR-DOS
                        might close the files that were opened earlier. Most
                        newer programs do not require FCBs. However, some
                        older programs might require you to set them. This is
                        a legacy feature, now replaced by the FILES handle
                        method as seen in the next CONFIG.SYS entry below. It
                        only remains here for backwards compatibility
                        purposes. Value set by default to safely run old
                        programs should be 10,4.

FILES[HIGH] or [HI]FILES=nn
                        Specifies the number of files that EDR-DOS can access
                        at one time.

[HI]STACKS=nn           Prevents stack overflow errors from happening upon
                        receiving a hardware interrupt. Multitasking and
                        networking environments are often sensitive to this
                        value being low. Stacks consume memory. If you find
                        instability on your system try by exchanging the below
                        value with "0,0", "9,128", "9,256" or "48,256". Always
                        perform a cold reboot after you make a change.

FASTOPEN=nnn
            Tracks the location of files on hard disk in memory for fast
            access. Valid values are in the range of 128 through 32768.
            Each file tracked requires 2 bytes of memory.
            
GETKEY      Pulls out an errorlevel depending on the keyboard key being hit. 
            Ideal for use in conjunction with ONERROR. 
            See GETKEY Addendum for key listings and corresponding errorlevel 
            codes.            

DRIVPARM=/d:nn ...
            Defines the physical characteristics of a specified disk drive.
            Use it to associate a particular type of physical disk drive with
            a logical drive. To add a 3.5-inch diskette drive to a computer
            that does not expect to use 3.5-inch diskette drives, for example,
            the DRIVPARM keyword is required to redefine the drive parameters
            for subsequent use by DOS.

            You can also use DRIVPARM to modify a logical drive already
            recognized by DOS but to add and define a new logical drive, you
            must use the DRIVER.SYS device driver instead.

            This is a highly specialized keyword most users should not need.
            For further details consult the DRIVEPARM Addendum.

HISTORY=ON|OFF,nnn,ON|OFF,ON|OFF,ON|OFF
            [Active],[Buffer],[Insert],[Search],[Match]
            [Active] Enables or disables HISTORY features (ON or OFF).
            [Buffer] Sets the storage buffer size (between 128 and 4096
            bytes).
            [Insert] Sets ON or OFF, character insertion in front of the
            cursor.
            [Search] Sets ON or OFF, the display of the most-recently-entered
            command that matches the current one by pressing <Ctrl> + <R>.
            [Match]  Sets ON or OFF, recalling the most-recently-entered
            command that matches each character you type, by pressing
            <Ctrl> + <_>.

[HI]INSTALL or INSTALL[HIGH]=program options
            Loads a program automatically from CONFIG.SYS when you start DOS.
            You can specify options to pass to the specified program

[HI]INSTALLLAST=cmdstring
            Works like [HI]INSTALL, but loads program after the DOS data
            segment relocation. It is effectively, the last INSTALL of them
            all to be ran.

DOSDATA=UMB             DOSDATA=LOW|UMB
                        Moves main DOS data segment to upper memory.

DDSCS=HIGH,UMB          DDSCS=UMB|HIGH|HIGH,UMB
                        Moves drive descriptor tables (DDSCS) to upper or high
                        memory.

XBDA=LOW,UMB            XBDA=LOW|UMB|LOW,UMB
                        Relocates extended BIOS data area (XBDA) to low base
                        or upper memory if the memory manager has not already
                        done this.

DEBLOCK=[nnnn|ON|OFF]   Value 0000 disables multitracking, which is the same
                        as OFF switch. Value FFFF enables multitracking, which
                        is the same as the ON switch. This was added for
                        MS-DOS 4.0x+ compatibility.

DOS=HIGH,UMB            Specifies that EDR-DOS should maintain a link to the
                        upper memory area, load part of itself into the high
                        memory area (HMA) and take advantage of upper memory
                        blocks (UMB) if they are available.
                        This keyword replaces the old HIDOS=ON/OFF.

SET [name[=string]]     Adds environment variables to the command processor's
                        master environment. Very useful to communicate to the
                        AUTOEXEC.BAT which multi-configuration option was
                        selected in the CONFIG.SYS, between other things.

SWITCHES=               Specifies special options in DOS.
                        /F Skips the two seconds delay after starting DOS
                        /N Prevents the user from using the F5 or F8 key to
                        bypass startup files.

DEVICE[HIGH]=filename   Loads a device driver.

REM or ; or ::          A line in the CONFIG.SYS begining with either of these
                        three characters sets, will not be executed and can be
                        used to add comments or to disable some keyword.

CHAIN=filename          Diverts execution of CONFIG.SYS keywords to another
                        file only if it exists at the specified location.

GOTO LABEL              Jumps execution to a CONFIG.SYS LABEL.

GOSUB LABEL             Jumps execution to a CONFIG.SYS LABEL subroutine that
                        ends in a RETURN keyword. It is very useful to save
                        space by avoiding repeating over and over again the
                        same group of keywords or to prevent a difficult to
                        follow CONFIG.SYS structure flow.

RETURN                  Jumps back to continue executing the CONFIG.SYS
                        immediately after the GOSUB or SWITCH keyword
                        which called this subroutine.

CLS                     Clears the screen contents and moves the cursor to the
                        begining of the first line.

CPOS=row,col            Sets cursor position to specified row and column
                        number of the current text mode screen.

COLOUR=[fg][,[bg][,bc]] Sets Foreground/Background/Border Colour.

TIMEOUT=n               Sets the waiting interval (in seconds) to
                        automatically jump CONFIG.SYS execution to the first
                        LABEL the SWITCH keyword has enumerated.

SWITCH MENU1, MENU2     Enumerates the different user selectable
                        multi-configuration options as LABELS.

ONERROR                 On matching errorlevel condition executes the
                        remaining part of the line. Conditions may be > or
                        < or = or => or <=. One example to better illustrate
                        its usage:
                        ONERROR =< 1 GOTO FAILURE

?                       Optional command execution that requires user keyboard
                        confirmation. To activate it, prepend it to the
                        required keyword. Example:
                        ?DEVICE=DRMOUSE.COM

ECHO string             Displays its arguments. Note that "ECHO" (without
                        double quotes and without any argument) will display
                        an empty line. Further neat tricks can be accomplished
                        with an active ANSI console driver and its escape
                        codes.

EXIT                    Defines the end of CONFIG.SYS execution.

ERROR=n                 Sets errorlevel (return code).

YESCHAR=                Allows to give a different character for the Yes-Char
                        (necessary to better cope with the questioning in
                        foreign countries, especially prior to any keyboard
                        driver loaded).

NUMLOCK=ON/OFF          Defines the status of the NumLock numeric pad key.
                        On old PCs the (PC) keyboard LEDs might not reflect
                        the actual status, but still may work anyway.

VERSION=n.nn[,n.nn]     Sets the DOS version (Int 21h/AH=30h) and optionally
                        the true DOS version (Int 21h/AX=3306h) to be reported
                        to programs.
